# Los Angeles Neighborhood Demographics

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive dashboard with Los Angeles neighborhood data. In the final product, users select a neighborhood and year to view information related to ethnicity, economy, and community. Datasets were cleaned and structured in MySQL, then exported to Tableau for visualization.

The SQL script is included in this repository.  
Data used in this script was downloaded from USC Neighborhood Data for Social Change, imported using MySQL Import Wizard, and joined with data from County of Los Angeles Open Data in MySQL.

The results of this script were then uploaded to Tableau and transformed into an interactive dashboard. See link below to view my dashboard.
